  CAD (Computer-Aided Design or Computer-Aided Design) is the use of technology to create designs
(generally 2D) and replaces the manual drawing process of a piece with an automated one. One of
the most popular such programs is AutoCAD. Such programs improve the designer's design quality
and productivity.
  Based on the initial data and input set instructions, it will produce a PNG file representing
the final image at the end of the command execution.

# Input data
  The name of the input file from which it is read is received as a program argument. The input
files will have the following structure:
  On the first line there will be a natural number N representing the total number of shapes to
be drawn in the drawing. The following N lines will contain information about each of N forms: the
position of a shape, its dimensions, and its color. The colors you'll need to use will be rendered in
the format: "#RGB A", where R, G, and B represent the red, green and blue pixels in hex (256 possible
values: 00, 01, 02, ... , 09, 0A, 0B, ..., 0F, 10, 11, ..., FE, FF), and A is the decimal value of Alpha
(opacity), taking values from 0 to 100.

  Of course, each form is different, so it will have a different format. The possibilities are as follows:
    ->  CANVAS <hight> <length> #RGB A
    ->  LINE <x start coordinate> <y start coordinate> <x finish coordinate> <y finish coordinate> #RGB A
    ->  SQUARE <the x coordinate of the top left corner> <the x coordinate of the top left corner> <length> #RGB A #RGB A
    ->  RECTANGLE <the x coordinate of the top left corner> <the y coordinate of the top left corner> <hight> <length> #RGB A #RGB A
    ->  CIRCLE <the x coordinate of the center> <the y coordinate of the center> <radius> #RGB A #RGB A 
    ->  TRIANGLE <the x coordinate of the first point> <the y coordinate of the first point>
                 <the x coordinate of the second point> <the y coordinate of the second point>
                 <the x coordinate of the third point> <the y coordinate of the third point> #RGB A #RGB A
    ->  DIAMOND <the x coordinate of the center> <the y coordinate of the center>
                <length of the horizontal diagonal> <length of the vertical diagonal> #RGB A #RGB A
    ->  POLYGON <number of vertices> <the x coordinate of a point> <the y coordinate of a point> #RGB A #RGB A
                  
# Note: I attached 2 input files cat.in, owl.in which will generate a PNG file for each input.
